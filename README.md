# MMM-NextCloud-Tasks

This is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/). Originally developed by [SoulofN00b](https://github.com/SoulOfNoob/MMM-NextCloud-Tasks/), further developed by [Starlingfire](https://github.com/starlingfire/MMM-NextCloud-Tasks). I have forked it and added new features.

This module loads a ToDo list via webDav from the NextCloud Tasks app using the "private link" and [NextCloud Managed Devices](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices)

You can toggle the status of the task via longpress / long touch and it will be sent to the Server.

Current development status: **released** \

## NextCloud preparations

1. Create a new app password in your Nextcloud installation at Settings > Security (under Personal) > Create New App Password
2. Give your app a name and generate the password: \

### Note:
If both conditions `startsInDays`and `dueInDays`are set both are checked after each other. So when one or both conditions are true the task will be shown.
If you get a *WebDav: Unknown error!* just wait for the next `updateInterval`. It is likely that you fetch your calendar as well from your Nextcloud. My suspicion is that there are too many server requests at the same time. Also, it might be a good idea to use all different prime numbers as `fetchInterval` for your calendar and here for this module (called `updateInterval`) as this minimizes the occurrence of fetching the data at the same time. You can find a list of prime numbers [here](http://compoasso.free.fr/primelistweb/page/prime/liste_online_en.php).

### The glow effect bug:
When you toggle a task there is a glow effect which strangely was offset on windows but not on a Raspberry Pi - or maybe it was the different screen. You will know what I mean if you see that there is s.th. wrong with the effect.
If that is the case use `offsetTop`and `offsetLeft` (in pixels, default is 0) in the settings to fix it.
