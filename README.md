# MMM-CalDAV-Tasks

This is a module for the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/). Originally developed by [SoulofN00b](https://github.com/SoulOfNoob/MMM-CalDAV-Tasks/), further developed by [Starlingfire](https://github.com/starlingfire/MMM-CalDAV-Tasks). I have forked it and added new features.

This module loads a ToDo list via CalDAV (e.g. from the NextCloud Tasks app using the "private link" and [Nextcloud Managed Devices](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices) )

You can toggle the status of the task via longpress / long touch and it will be sent to the Server.

Current development status: **released** \

## Dependencies

- Working CalDAV Server (e.g. NextCloud with installed Tasks app)

## NextCloud preparations
> [!WARNING]
> While you could login with your normal NextCloud credentials, you should generate a new app password for performance reasons (https://help.nextcloud.com/t/very-high-latency-on-card-cal-webdav-due-to-http-authorization-basic/200107)

1. Create a new app password in your NextCloud installation at Settings > Security (under Personal) > Create New App Password\
3. Give your app a name and generate the password: \

4. Create the Private Link to the ToDo list you want to display like this: \

## Using the module

To use this module, add the following most important settings in the configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```js
var config = {
    modules: [

            module: 'MMM-CalDAV-Tasks',
            config: {
                // See 'Configuration options' for more information.
                
                webDavAuth: {
                    url: "<CalDAV_URL>",
                    username: "<CalDAV_APP_USERNAME>",
                    password: "<CalDAV_APP_PASSWORD>",

| ~~`hideCompletedTasks`~~ | ~~*Optional*: should completed tasks show up or not~~

### The glow effect bug:
When you toggle a task there is a glow effect which strangely was offset on windows but not on a Raspberry Pi - or maybe it was the different screen. You will know what I mean if you see that there is s.th. wrong with the effect.
| `developerMode`      | *Optional*: When developing under Windows the Fontawesome Icons do not load. This just embeds Fontawesome from an external source. Default `false`

If you do not see the effect at all this is likely due to another module. For instance I wanted my calendar module to download a public holidays calendar from the internet resulting in hundreds of errors per minute. Removing that calendar solved it.

### 🐞General bug handling:
See my example some lines above how fast a bug comes from another module. Go to your Magic Mirror folder and `npm run start:dev` to chase the bugs!

### Note:
If both conditions `startsInDays`and `dueInDays`are set both are checked after each other. So when one or both conditions are true the task will be shown.
If you get a *WebDav: Unknown error!* just wait for the next `updateInterval`. It is likely that you fetch your calendar as well from your CalDAV. My suspicion is that there are too many server requests at the same time. Also, it might be a good idea to use all different prime numbers as `fetchInterval` for your calendar and here for this module (called `updateInterval`) as this minimizes the occurrence of fetching the data at the same time. You can find a list of prime numbers [here](http://compoasso.free.fr/primelistweb/page/prime/liste_online_en.php).
